<h2>My Top 3 Anime Recently</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Jujutsu Kaisen</h3>
<p>Jujutsu Kaisen is airing recently, which is a complete emotional rollercoster to watch.</p>

<h3>Bleach</h3>
<p>Bleach has the best animations and storyline. But it is annoying to see the postponing of new episode.</p>

<h3>The Great Cleric</h3>
<p>This anime is good to watch when we want to relax and have a little bit of stress relief.</p>
